# Neural-Network
Used Neural Netwrok with varying layers of neurons and Epoches to calcualte accuracy.

TASK:1
A full connected neural network that inputs a Cifar-10 image and predicts output of shape (10000, 
10) 10 outputs, 1 probability for each class

TO FIND: 
- Accuracy of model with 5 neurons, Epoches=5, No Conv2D and MaxPooling  layers
- Accuracy of model with 5 neurons, Epoches=10, with Conv2D and MaxPooling layers .
-  Reults: Accuracy improved to 45.9% with first layer of 5 neurons.


2) Part2) 
Now we will increase first layer of 64 neurons, 2 Conv2d and 2 Maxpooling layers
Result: Accuracy improved to 76.12%


3) Part 3)
1 NN accuracy was found to be 14%
Na√Øve Bayes accuracy was found to be: 17%
CNN accuracy at 10th epoch is 76.12%
